  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p id=summ>The goal of this project is to create an application for iOS and Android that can act as a digital assistant. It can help monitor and remind the user about <br>
    their daily schedules. Examples may include people suffering from alzheimer’s or dementia. It can remind them of daily necessities such as having meals, <br>
    taking necessary medications or any upcoming appointments. Furthermore, it can also remind someone about activities like meetings, to exercise, calling <br>
    a family member. Accessibility is also a key factor, the UI will be designed with a few options; 100% voice activation, large simpler UI and a more <br>
    advanced UI for those that want all the customisation.
</p>
<h3>Why do we want to create this product?</h3>
<p id=motiv>
<cite> <a href="#s1"</href><i>[1]</i></a></cite> According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), dementia, a neurological disorder affecting the memory, affects 50 million people worldwide and it is known <br>
to be a major cause of disability and dependency for the elderly. Therefore, the main motivation for the creation of this project is to help people suffering  <br>
from alzheimer's or dementia and improve their quality of life without the need for a social worker to be there more regularly. It can greatly improve the  <br>
quality of life of many sufferers by allowing them to feel independent and relieve some of the stress from those working in care services.
</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p id=description>The main feature of this application is the timed reminders via any combination of emails, SMS or voiced messages from the application to help people keep on <br>
  top of their daily schedules. Elderly people or those suffering from any number of diseases or illnesses that affect the mind, such as alzheimers and dementia, <br>
  can have trouble remembering to take their medications and keeping track of their appointments, this application can be set to remind them constantly, daily, <br>
  weekly, etc. This can also be used to assist the user in meals such that they it can remind them of meal times and provide them with ideas on what they could <br>
  prepare and instruct them through the meal preparation like a live recipe. <br>

<br>
The data for the application can be saved both locally and in the cloud to allow the social workers to adjust anything remotely to save the need to constantly <br>
visit the patient personally or just to allow access to the settings from any other mobile device the user owns. <br>
<br>
The user interface will be designed with 3 main templates:
The first will be designed with few but large options; On, Settings, Off. On will be a pause & resume function, Settings will include the timers for everything <br>
and other settings for visual and audio functions, and Off will stop the application. <br>
The 2nd will be purely voice command based; basically the same as the simpler function but via your voice. For example, “Settings. 1pm medication.” will set a <br>
reminder for that time. This can be used in combination with either of the other options. <br>
The last will be more complicated with options such as importing your own UI designs, fonts, among many other possible things for those more familiar with tech. <br>
<br>

An example of how the voiced automated reminder will work for a male elderly for a with Alzheimers for a morning to afternoon routine:
<li>A wake up call at 8am, followed by his morning routine to brush his teeth and shave.</li>
<li>Collect his newspaper at 9am from the front door and begin preparing breakfast.</li>
<li>Voice the breakfast food options that he would usually have (e.g. toast and scrambled eggs, muffin). If needed, the user will have the option to choose on the app <br>
 &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;if he requires instructions to make the meal.</li>
<li>A reminder of the newspaper that he can read while eating breakfast..</li>
<li>By 11am, it will then remind him to go for a walk or jog around the block. </li>
<li>At 12pm, lunch will be voiced similar to the breakfast routine though with different food options. </li>
<br>

A few examples for a busy office worker: <br>
<li>A wake up call at 6am.</li>
<li>Options for breakfast listed while doing his wake up routine. </li>
<li>Reminder of any tools or papers required to bring to the office that day. </li>
<li>Advanced notice of any meetings during the day while commuting to work. </li>
<li>Reminders throughout the day to take breaks for stretching. </li>
<li>After the work day is over, it will list any engagements for the evening, such as a work dinner or just catching up with friends.</li>
</p>

<h3>Necessary Tools</h3>
<p id=tools>The SDKs for iOS and android will be necessary to port the app over. The use of the Alexa API will be needed to get the voice features to function cheaply <br>
   and efficiently, and AWS for access to the cloud. Either C or Java can be used, so an appropriate IDE will be needed, such as Atom. Tools for visual prototyping <br>
   will be useful in ensuring the application looks appealing early in development.</p>
<h3>Necessary Skills</h3>
<p id=skills>Experience with Android and iOS will be necessary as those are the target platforms for this application. <br>
Sound knowledge of Java or C is required to create the base app, as well as how to incorporate the Alexa API into the application.  <br>
The assistance of a front end developer to design and build the interface so it looks professional and appeals to a larger amount of people.  <br>
Most of this can be outsourced from a number of online databases or contractors, however the main code will need to be written internally due to potential security <br>
risks.
</p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p id=outcome>If the ambitions can be reached, this project will be able to help the lives of many people suffering from memory-related illnesses. It will allow them to live  <br>
a higher quality of life and to be less reliant on social workers and close family to look after them. It would reduce the burden from having to keep a close eye on loved ones suffering <br>
 from memory-related illnesses, reducing stress and worry and allowing more free time for their own lives. <br>
It would also reduce the daily burdens on those living busy lives and allow them to worry less about the little things.
