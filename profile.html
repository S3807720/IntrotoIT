<h3>About me</h3>
I was born in Australia, my mothers side is mostly German, fathers is various European. I am an English native but I can speak Japanese as well. <br>
Did high school and spent a few years learning Japanese via self study. One of my main hobbies is playing or reading about video games, I generally<br>
stick to RPG and action-based games. One of my favorite series is “Trails of..” or Kiseki.<br>


During the end of primary school I became interested in playing around with the family computer. It started with games but ended up including <br>
image editing and coding things, mainly to edit games to how I want them. Beginning in high school, my parents bought me my own computer, <br>
I started to play more with hardware and spent far too long breaking and fixing my computer.<br>

I chose RMIT as it had the most extensive program to learn a bit of everything and find which particularly field I want to specialize in.<br>

I expect to learn skills related to most areas of IT; security, programming, web, etc. With a focus on programming and web related fields <br>
which will give many possible career options in the future.<br><br>


<h3>Ideal Job</h3>
https://www.seek.com.au/job/39154945 <br><br>
<img src="assets/ITJ.jpg"
alt="IT Job" width="300"><br>
Project management entails leading every part of a project; planning the project, budgeting, ensuring smooth development throughout the projects <br>
life and if necessary, to assist with the development should it be required.<br><br>

This position appeals to me because I love the challenge of managing all the details of a job. Ensuring tasks get completed on time, motivating <br>
staff and just making sure everything goes smoothly. I love the stress and challenges of that sort of work, the accomplishment you and your team <br>
feel when it’s finally finished is blissful.<br><br>

The skills and experiences required would be advanced knowledge of programming and the many languages, and many years experience. Extensive experience <br>
with customer service systems and security is also required along with management experience. For this particular job, experience and references are <br>
more important than formal qualifications.<br><br>

My current skill set is very lacking and this job would be many years away, my programming skills are very basic – simple java and html. Experience wise,<br>
I have extensive customer service experience which should be beneficial with learning the CRM systems but otherwise I am quite lacking there too.<br>

My current plan is to focus on this degree to learn about all the general IT subjects, while on the side I intend to delve deeper into the other languages<br>
and other useful subjects. I also plan on changing careers to an entry IT job such as admin while studying to get my foot in the industry.<br><br>



<h3>Personality Tests</h3>
INTJ<br>
Vision oriented. Quietly innovative. Insightful. Conceptual. Logical. Seeks understanding. Critical. Decisive.<br>
Independent. Determined. Pursues competence, improvement.<br>
<br>
Visual/Tactile learner <br>
Learn with vision / hands-on<br>
<br>
Big 5 Personality<br>
Extroversion 1<br>
Emotional Stability 66<br>
Agreeableness 45<br>
Conscientiousness 84<br>
Intellect/Imagination 34<br>
<br>
These results pretty much mean I’m more of an independent worker and that I learn in a simpler method, by seeing or doing rather than reading or <br>
I may have trouble working efficiently with others due to the preference of working alone but it’s unlikely for any emotional conflicts to occur. <br>

In a team I may insist on doing a task by myself rather than asking for assistant or cooperate which may hinder the pace, but would be considerate to others feelings. <br>

When forming a team, the preference to work alone should be taken into consideration, would possibly be detrimental to be matched with very vocal and easy to <br>
anger people. With similar, more independent personalities it could also cause issues with a lack of teamwork. Being grouped with more patient and considerate <br>
members would probably be the ideal match for my type, I think. <br>
